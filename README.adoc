= Atlanmod Zoo

Atlanmod Zoo is a set of Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) Ecore models,
which can be easily integrated to projects that require these models.

== Objectives

The main goal of this project is to share EMF models among developers.

These models come from different http://www.atlanmod.org[Atlanmod] projects,
where they are used either for testing purposes
or as main artifacts.

For instance, the model of Java's abstract syntax comes from the https://www.eclipse.org/MoDisco/[Modisco]
reverse engineering tool and can be used to build tools that use
Modisco's models as an input for metrics analysis, code modernization,
etc.

== Available Models

Currently, two kinds of models are available: (i) models for generating
standard EMF models and (ii) models for generating NeoEMF specific code.

=== Standard EMF resources

Some examples of standard EMF available models are:

- link:./emf.graph/[Simple graph]: A simple syntax for representing oriented
graphs mostly used for testing purposes.
- link:./emf.java/[Java]: Java language syntax model, used by the https://www.eclipse.org/MoDisco/[Modisco] tool.
- link:./emf.cobol/[Cobol]: COBOL language syntax model.
- link:./emf.kdm/[KDM]: Knowledge Discovery Metamodel (KDM), used by the https://www.eclipse.org/MoDisco/[Modisco] tool.
- link:./emf.smm[SMM]; Structured Metrics Meta-model.
- link:./emf.socialnetwork/[Social Network]: The TTC 2018 Social Media Case, presented in https://github.com/TransformationToolContest/ttc2018liveContest[TTC18].

=== NeoEMF resources

Ecore models for using together with https://neoemf.atlanmod.org/[NeoEMF] model persistence solution:

* link:./neoemf-java/[Java]: Java language syntax model.

== Maven Usage

Models from the atlanmod Zoo are available as independent Maven artifacts.
For instance, the dependency for Modisco Java's abstract syntax is:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <artifactId>emf-java</artifactId>
    <groupId>org.atlanmod.zoo</groupId>
    <version>1.0.4</version>
</dependency>
----

All models expect EMF artifacts to be provided by the environment.
If you intend to use these models outside Eclipse, we suggest taking a look at the
https://github.com/atlanmod/emf-maven[EMF-Maven] project.

== Eclipse Update Site

Ecore models are also available as Eclipse Plugins.
Use these update site to install the suitable plugin:

* https://www.atlanmod.org/zoo/releases/snapshot/plugin[Snapshots]
* https://www.atlanmod.org/zoo/releases/latest/plugin/[Releases]

== Repository organization

This repository only contains models expressed in https://wiki.eclipse.org/Xcore[Xcore].
The EMF underlying code is generated with the https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation/350_continuous_integration.html[Xtext Maven Plugin].

== Contributing

This project is open for new models: if you want to share your own models,
follow the structured used in our models to create a new artifact and perform a pull request.
