= Atlanmod Zoo

Atlanmod Zoo is a set of Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) Ecore models,
which can be easily integrated to projects that require these models.

== Objectives

The main goal of this project is to share EMF models among developers.

These models come from different http://www.atlanmod.org[Atlanmod] projects,
where they are used either for testing purposes
or as main artifacts.

For instance, the model of Java's abstract syntax comes from the https://www.eclipse.org/MoDisco/[Modisco]
reverse engineering tool and can be used to build tools that use
Modisco's models as an input for metrics analysis, code modernization,
etc.

== Available Models

Currently, two kinds of models are available: (i) models for generating
standard EMF models and (ii) models for generating NeoEMF specific code.

=== Standard EMF resources

Some examples of standard EMF available models are:
- link:./emf-graph/[Simple graph]: A simple syntax for representing oriented
graphs (mostly used for testing purposes.
- link:./emf-java/[Java]: Java language syntax model, used by the https://www.eclipse.org/MoDisco/[Modisco] tool)
- link:./emf-cobol/[Cobol]: COBOL language syntax model.
- link:./emf-smm[SMM]; Structured Metrics Meta-model.

=== NeoEMF resources

Ecore models for using together with the http://www.neoemf.com[NeoEMF] model persistence solution:

* link:./neoemf-java/[Java]: Java language syntax model.

== Usage

Models from the atlanmod Zoo are available as independent Maven plugins.
For instance, the dependency for Modisco Java's abstract syntax is:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <artifactId>emf-java</artifactId>
    <groupId>org.atlanmod.zoo</groupId>
    <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

== Repository organization

This repository only contains models expressed in https://wiki.eclipse.org/Xcore[Xcore].
The EMF underlying code is generated with the https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation/350_continuous_integration.html[Xtext Maven Plugin].

== Contributing

This project is open for new models: if you want to share your own models,
follow the structured used in our models to create a new artifact and perform a pull request.
